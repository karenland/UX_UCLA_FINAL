# UX_UCLA_FINAL


<h2> Introductions </h2>
Not only is reading a popular hobby among the elderly but United States citizens aged 65 years and older are actually the biggest age group that read as a hobby. As more elderly readers are transitioning into e-reading, they need mobile applications where not only can they organize their books but as well as accomplish other book related tasks such as writing reviews, joining book groups, and rating books. All of which help elevate their reading experience. However, there is no good application that keeps in mind the elderly and those who may need more accessibility-friendly design components. This project provides a new outlet for aging book readers to connect with others as well as delve deeper in their reading journeys by providing users an application with easy transitional steps and the ability to customize their app experience.

<h2>Design Statement:</h2>
An important fact to keep in mind about the United States is that the population is aging. By 2080, it is estimated that 25% of Americans from the United States will be over 60 years old.  
Currently. Aging America has actually been struggling with literacy rates. They have limited prose and comprehension skills. While many users are the elderly, many elderly also lose/feel less confident about their reading ability. An app that not only entices avid book readers but also casual readers is very important to combat these issues since a user-friendly app that makes reading fun allows for the elderly not to only engage with others and bring a new level of enjoyment towards a valuable hobby, but it also helps the elderly better their genre literacy and technological literacy skills. So, for my project I hope I can give them an enjoyable app experience that can be paired with their reading journey.

<h2>Competitor Analysis - Usability Testing: </h2>

Again, GoodReads is a popular app for avid book readers. It allows users to friend one another, write reviews, create book lists and even join book groups to discuss reads with fellow peers. 

So for this project, the Usability Test will ask the user to perform some tasks on the GoodReads IOS application. From their interactions and comments, we are able to learn more about the site’s interface as well as to study its strengths/weaknesses. Generally, UT is an important step during the UI process because it enables the designers and researchers to efficiently study user behavior and opinions to create a better project early in stages of the project. The two tasks the user were asked to do was to:
•	search for your favorite book, give it a start-rating, and then write a review about it.
•	Explore a book’s info/profile page
•	Create a bookshelf with at least three books
•	Revisit the user’s review to see if it has any comments 
•	Reply to any comments then log out

<h2> UX Research: Contextual inquiry </h2> 
To further study the user, specifically the context experience exists in, we used Contextual Inquiry. This qualitative data collection method allows us to observe people and ask for feedback as they are doing tasks. So for the book-reading experience, we get to learn about not simply the basic tasks one might do outside of applications but also their thoughts and emotions that go along with the reading journey. The results of this method allow us to better define the requirements and improvements that the book domain needs. For this project, the participant was asked how they generally search and look up books as well as how would they describe their reading experiences (eg. a solitary excursion or one shared with friends/peers).

<h2>UX StoryTelling:</h2>
UX storytelling is when researchers create and utilize personas, journey maps and other storytelling components in order to build empathy and as well get insight into users. Storytelling is also useful as a means to present ideas and gain new ones as you explore the word through the user’s eyes. To add, this process allows the whole team working on the project to be aware of the users’ needs. My design is basically a revamped GoodReads app formatted for the elderly. 

Key features of design:
Generally speaking, the apps I explored related to my project are all extremely limiting so the functions I have focusing on will simply give users more freedom.


•	An updated search function that filters results by if the search inquiry is a book, another user, author, a book list, or a book group
•	The ability to change the language of the app
